# DanceMusicGenerator
## About
A hackathon project for the HoloLens where dancing generates a dubstep track. As you move, a consistent beat will be played
along with random dubstep samples. This project was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBbwKoCj62k) and
the clips used as 'tunes' were all from his video. It wasn't included in the repo, because the content creator requested for
the audio clips to not be re-distributed.

## How To Use
You may clone the repository, download the sound clip (or make your own) and build it for the HoloLens.

## Video Samples & Gifs
